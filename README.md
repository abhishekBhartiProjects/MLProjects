# MLProjects
- This package contains various mini-projects (mainly for learning or beginner level projects). 

## classification.py 
- A simple prediction based machine learning technique. This Uses sklearn to classify input data.

## iris_dataset.py 
- Uses online available iris-dataset and extracts different useful datas in form of graphs. It also created a custom model to train algo with 80% of data and validate with remaining 20% data. Then accuracy of training is compared betwwen different available known algorithms.

- Top 30 dataset and few descriptions of dataset
